            Starting in 2017 i used to be in the computer science world, and while i was developing
            a personal website (long gone now) i had to manipulate some images and develop some designs
            and banners, that made me remember that i really like to draw and work with visual arts
            in general. So in 2018 i got back at drawing and i did mostly digital art.
            Fast forward to 2022 and i'm sick and tired of working as a software engineer so i start to do
            more artistic stuff and tattoo. In 2023 i decided to quit developing software and put my energy
            into doing something i love. This portfolio is a collection of my art over the few different
            mediums i've explored so far.
