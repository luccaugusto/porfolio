        I started tattooing in the beginning of 2022, handpoking some small stuff in my legs. I found out I really enjoy it
        and started tattooing friends the same year. In 2023 I quit my job as a Software Engineer after working in that area for
        about 4 years and decided to put more time in tattooing to do it professionally. I'm always learning and looking up to artists
        that are on the vanguard of their styles, also I love artists that are more underground, I'm always with the underdogs.
        I'm leaning towards doing blackwork, sometimes trashy sometimes dotwork, but tending towards bolder lines. Currently I'm
        working to develop a style that mixes handpoking and machine tattooing, as I do love handpoking and the more traditional
        aspects of tattooing. I do plan on adding some color to my work in the future leaning towards neotrad or new school,
        but one step at a time.

        My art style tends a lot towards cartoon style surreal, psychedelic, funny stuff, Drawing things that do not exist or things with a twist.
        I'm also experimenting with more realistic drawings currently.
