<p class="font15 bio-paragraph">
    In my time as a software engineer i've worked with a few websites both in the frontend and the backend.
    I've worked on commercial websites doing the layout and design of the pages and tools.
    I have also developed the full identity for the podcast "Papo de Sauna", every season the theme changes
    and so does the visual of the website, episode images and everything else, this makes my work at Papo de Sauna
    the most interesting in my opinion.
